				<h1 className="info">
					Creating New and bright futures in Tech
				</h1>
				<p className="details-description_1">
					Breaking into the tech industry requires a number of
					factors: industry-relevant knowledge, connections, specific
					hard and soft skills, an understanding of how to navigate
					the job search, and the technical interviewing process.
					​​Many college CS programs don't have the depth of resources
					or support needed to practically set students up for career
					success, like keeping up with the latest industry trends,
					building employer partnerships, and providing access to
					critical internships where students can get a foothold in
					the industry.
				</p>
				<p className="details-description_2">
					Even the most well-funded, prestigious programs can have
					gaps–from microaggressions in the classroom to lack of
					personal support–that prevent an equitable and comprehensive
					education. These barriers are particularly detrimental to
					Black, Latino/a, Indigenous, first-generation, and
					low-income students.
				</p>
				<p className="details-description_3">
					<strong>We at CodeWalker vowed to change that.</strong> We
					believe tech excellence lies at the intersection of skill
					and opportunity. We also believe that tech excellence can be
					within reach for anyone if given the right resources and the
					chance to apply them. When bright CS students, CS college
					programs, and top tech employers come together, all can
					benefit and create a new, more inclusive future of tech.
